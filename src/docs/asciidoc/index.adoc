A Nextflow plugin that provides a web-based interface for visualizing and exploring Nextflow pipeline executions directly in your browser.

== Overview

nf-cachebrowser is a powerful Nextflow plugin that allows you to visualize pipeline executions through an intuitive web interface.
Monitor your workflows, explore execution details, and analyze pipeline performance without leaving your browser.

== Features

- üåê **Web-based Interface** - Access pipeline execution data through a modern web UI
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring** - Track running pipelines in real-time (only in not blocking supported storages)
- üîç **Detailed Execution View** - Explore individual process executions and their outputs
- üìà **Performance Analytics** - Analyze execution times, resource usage, and bottlenecks
- üóÇÔ∏è **Cache Management** - Browse and manage Nextflow work directories and cached results
- üîÑ **Resume Capabilities** - Visualize pipeline resume points and execution flow
- üì± **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

== Screenshots

First, run some pipeline with `--resume` flag

[source]
----
nextflow run hello --resume
----

After some executions run the plugin:

[source]
----
nextflow plugin nf-cachebrowser:run
----

The run command execute a web server at port 9999 so you can navigate to http://localhost:9999

INFO:: By the moment, to close the web server you need to send a kill signal (or Ctrl+C)

== Parameters

- -p --port , the web server port, 9999 by default

- --directory, the directory where .nextflow is located, current dir by default


== Local Storage (default)

nf-cachebrowser is able to visualize different "storages".

Typical storage is "local", the default implementation of Nextflow, using an embedded database to store all
executions details located in the `.nextflow/cache` folder

WARNING:: Due the blocking nature of the library used by Nextflow, two process *can't* read/write at the same time
the database, so use nf-cachebrowser once your pipelines are ended.

== DuckDB Storage (experimental)

Incremental Steps has been working in `nf-duckdbcache` plugin to reemplace the default implementation.

DuckDB allows multiple process to access to the database so it expected you can execute pipelines and at the same
time use nf-cachebrowser

== Postgres Storage (TODO!!)

In the same way as DuckDB database, we're working in a plugin to use Postgres as cache. nf-cachebrowser will allow
inspect this storage

== Rename Workdir

You can rewrite the storage changing the `workdir` to a new path using the `rename` command.

This can be useful in case you want to move the storage to a new location, for example.

The command:

`nextflow plugin nf-cachebrowser:rename /current/path /new/path/to/use`

will replace in all tasks with `workdir` as `/current/path` to `/new/path/to/use`

Also, You can specify to apply the rename only to a task:

`nextflow plugin nf-cachebrowser:rename --task helloWorld /current/path /new/path/to/use`
